      <h1>Greetings! I'm Keyona, pronounced Key-O-Na.</h1>
      <div class="bio-text">
        <h1> My introduction to design.</h1>
        <p> Typography was the first indicator to me of the power of design. I can recall as early as elementary school when my favorite part of an essay or presentation would be getting to decide the images, fonts, colors, and layouts that I would use. I didn’t think of it as design at the time. All I knew is that I loved being able to create a feeling using these elements to further convey the message of my writing. I was fearless with my experimentation and often spent hours browsing through fonts just to find “the one”.  Meanwhile, I may have silently judged my peers who played it safe by using the default Times Roman 12 pt font. One of my proudest moments at this time was for a  book report I wrote on Harry Potter in the 4th Grade.  I looked through every page of  Microsoft Document clipart to find the perfect owl image to perch at the top of my paper. I made sure to choose a  font that was bold and did justice to the magical feel of the Harry Potter universe. That book report ended up earning me a trip to the Principal’s Office.  Despite thinking I was being sent there for doing something wrong, my extra efforts ended up gaining me sticker and a free ice cream ticket to recognize my work. </p>
        <h1> Why design is important to me.</h1>
        <p>Design to me  is an accessible tool to infuse magic into the mundane. If you’re familiar with the show Queer Eye on Netflix, you’ll know exactly what I mean. The design wizardry that Bobby Berk does on each hero’s living quarters is nothing short of striking. Also the way I see it, something as simple as a  logo has the ability orchestrate connections. People build community using these symbols as representation of their shared values. Even trust can be built through good design. For instance, the font and color scheme of a website could truly be the difference between me making a purchase or not.</p>
          <h1>How I’ll use design to make a difference.</h1>
          <p>Working at a variety of businesses in customer service roles I have seen first hand what type of problems can arise when users interact with a website or even a restaurant menu. From painfully tight knit layouts to counterintuitive user flows I have had to attempt to excuse the reasoning for these design choices to customers. However, since I am an avid Oprah fan and self-help book enthusiast I grew into the headspace that I felt I was called to do more. I no longer wanted to simply deal with the aftermath of the pain points these design choices were creating. I wanted to be a part of the team that would find the solutions that would improve the experiences for users.  So with fierce determination (similar to the picture below of Oprah walking across the a pile of burning coals) I am building my design skills with the vision of creating a more harmonic digital landscape.</p>
