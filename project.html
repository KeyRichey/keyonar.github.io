        <h2> <b>Problem</b> </h2>
        <p>Travelers are using cloud storage services to upload pictures, create and share documents, discover resources, and organize their files.  With multiple cloud storage services available it is possible for them to complete these tasks. However, there is a lack of an app that has all of these features within one platform. Users are left spreading different elements of their trip across different applications. This leads to a cumbersome and inefficient experience.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="Solution">
        <h2> <b>Solution</b> </h2>
        <p>Happy Nomad aims to provide travelers a simple and intuitive experience. Empowering users with the ability to upload content, create and organize content, discover content from other users, and collaborate with others in one platform across desktop and mobile devices. Users also have the option to organize their files in an old-fashioned Folder or create a  Board for a more visually appealing layout.</p>

          <img src= "assets/images/GoogleDrive.png" alt= "Google Drive Icon">
          <p> Google Drive gives users  the ability to upload items. However, in order to create an item,  a separate app needs to be accessed. This is especially problematic when using the app on a mobile device.</p>
          <img src= "assets/images/Pinterest.png" alt= "Pinterest Icon">
          <p>Pinterest has a distinct feature in allowing users to create moodboards which is unique and an aesthetically pleasing organization tool.  However, they are  limited in the file types they host, and they don’t have the ability for users to create their own content through the platform.</p>
          <img src= "assets/images/Dropbox.png" alt= "Dropbox Icon">
          <p>Dropbox has a simple and clean aesthetic, but it is also limited in the file types that can be created and uploaded within the platform. Additionally their platform contains buttons that aren’t clear in communicating what their function are. </p>

            <li><p>Users want to be able to create content in different file types, and organize them in folders or moodboards.</p></li>
            <li><p>Users want to explore content uploaded by other users.</p></li>

Most respondents used competitors I had already analyzed, including Google Drive and Dropbox. Knowing this information allowed me insight into what may be the objective for the app. In this stage I believed the app should offer the best features of competitors in a single platform, offer a better organization method, and be visually fun.</p>

          <p>This testing proved to be very informative. Problem areas were brought to the forefront. As I was able to see parts of the upload and organize flows I had missed.</p>
          <p>Moving forward I knew I needed to revise the prototype to include success complete notifications within the flows for uploading, creating, and organizing items. Implementing this would increase the clear communication I was aiming to create with the user.

            <p><b>Applying the branding to the wireframes, I created a high fidelity mockup. Leveraging the content within the moodboard I referred back to it as a reminder of the feelings I wanted to convey in the final design.</b></p>
            <p>I was able to pull inspiration for different imagery and experiment with different  iterations for the visual design. An additional focus of the visual design was to provide a good user experience by  maintaining consistency. I utilized style  to educate  users by establishing expectations through elements like buttons and links.</p>

            <p>The images below illustrate how I iterated with variations of color, opacity, and size. This is how I reached a design solution that had the optimal legible contrast, visual hierarchy, and clean aesthetic.  </p>

            <p><b>Despite, overall success in the functionality of the applications features. I still was unsure about some elements of the visual design. The visual design still lacked the bright and joyful tone I was trying to convey. So using A/B  testing I was able to see what users would prefer and why. </b></p>
            <p>Pictured below is one test that was used to determine the best color for the call to action buttons. 50% of respondents chose the blue button, and said the red button felt too alarming like something was wrong. The remaining 50% chose the red button because they felt the blue button was not eye catching enough. Despite the split result, I was able to use the feedback to find a compromise between the two colors by using hot pink. A color that is both eye-catching but doesn't evoke alarm.</p>

            <p> Despite having some doubt that there would be a way to offer a unique cloud storage service, due to the space being crowded.  However, it was  helpful to evaluate  competitors, and discover that they were under serving the traveling market. This research helped immensely in creating a distinguishable competitive advantage. In further development of the application  I recognized the importance of having a thorough  survey.  It provided invaluable insight and details from users that I served as  strong foundation for the application, and that I could refer to at different stages.</p>
            <p>Another  key insight I learned through working on this application  is that testing is the best way to silence your inner critic. Due to  the endless options available in design overthinking can go into overdrive. However, clarity quickly comes when you  see a real user navigate  the application.</p>
