          <h2> <b>Problem</b> </h2>
          <p>Travelers are using cloud storage services to upload pictures, create and share documents, discover resources, and organize their files.  With multiple cloud storage services available it is possible for them to complete these tasks. However, there is a lack of an app that has all of these features within one platform. Users are left spreading different elements of their trip across different applications. This leads to a cumbersome and inefficient experience.</p>

          <h2> <b>Solution</b> </h2>
          <p>Happy Nomad aims to provide travelers a simple and intuitive experience. Empowering users with the ability to upload content, create and organize content, discover content from other users, and collaborate with others in one platform across desktop and mobile devices. Users also have the option to organize their files in an old-fashioned Folder or create a  Board for a more visually appealing layout.</p>

          <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <h2><b>What will be the competitive advantage?</b></h2>
          <p><b>To begin my research I analyzed the features of three top companies in the the cloud storage space. I was specifically looking through the lenses of their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.  These discoveries allowed me to develop assumptions on what users are missing in a cloud storage app that I could develop a solution for.</b></p>
          <p> Google Drive gives users  the ability to upload items. However, in order to create an item,  a separate app needs to be accessed. This is especially problematic when using the app on a mobile device.</p>
          <p>Pinterest has a distinct feature in allowing users to create moodboards which is unique and an aesthetically pleasing organization tool.  However, they are  limited in the file types they host, and they don’t have the ability for users to create their own content through the platform.</p>
          <p>Dropbox has a simple and clean aesthetic, but it is also  limited in the file types that can be created and uploaded within the platform. Additionally their platform containts buttons that aren’t clear in communicating what their function is. </p>

            <p><b>Next, I distributed a user survey to airline workers, Facebook travel groups and some of my peers to test if my assumptions were credible. In addition, I used the survey to discover more details about what the right combination of features users think should  be in the solution.</b></p>
            <img src="http://lorempixel.com/350/260/abstract/placeholder-1" alt="project screenshot"/>
            <p><b>Beyond the traditional features of a cloud storage app, users wanted more distinct features that would be beneficial for their travel related needs.</b></p>

              <li>A mood board feature in order to bring together different ideas when planning a trip.</li>

              <li>To see inspirational and informational content shared by other users.</li>
              <li>Another feature users wanted to have in regards to collaboration was the ability to receive notifications if changes have been made to an item, and to  be able to share through social media, or emailing a link.</li>

            <p>Also, in regards to current applications users said they enjoyed these features  about current cloud storage:<p>

              <p>Within the survey results I was also able to identify the pain points users are experiencing when using current apps. Most respondents used competitors I had already analyzed, including Google Drive and Dropbox. Knowing this information allowed me insight into what may be the objective for the app. In this stage I believed the app should offer the best features of competitors in a single platform, offer a better organization method, and be visually fun.</p>
              <p>Too many different applications are needed.</p>
              <p>Difficult to keep content organized</p>

            <p><b>Using the digital wireframes I created a clickable prototype. I then conducted the first round of usability testing.  I asked users to complete specific tasks which included, signing up, uploading an item, and organizing a folder.</b></p>
            <p>Here are some of the key findings:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Participants  easily recognized this app is travel related and what  features they would be able to use with the app.</li>
              <li>The sign up task was the easiest and quickest for both participants to complete. </li>
              <li>Participants were unsure if the item had actually uploaded. Therefore I will be adding a screen that displays an upload confirmation notice. </li>
              <li> One particpant was confused during the organization task. As the function only allowed them to send files to other folders. They wanted to be able organize files within the folder and didn’t understand why they couldn’t. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>This testing proved to be very informative. Problem areas were brought to the forefront. As I was able to see parts of the upload and organize flows I had missed.</b></p>
            <p>Moving forward I knew I needed to revise the prototype to include success complete notifications within the flows for uploading, creating, and organizing items. Implementing this would increase the clear communication I was aiming to create with the user. To solve the second problem I would re-design the organize flow to include an option to organize within the current folder.</p>

                  <p><b>I then focused on creating a brand identity for the application. I started to determine what the brand’s values would be by creating a moodboard and word list. The core values chosen were joy and playfulness of traveling. The name is meant to describe the users as they use the service. It’s so simple and helpful they can’t help but be happy on their travels. </b></p>
                  <p>It was challenging creating a logo that would convey these values without making it too cartoon like. I eventually landed the perfect combination that utilized negative space to create  a smile and a  hot air balloon icon. For the color palette yellow and blue were chosento convey warmth and security. Elements like buttons, icons, and fonts were given rounded corners to avoid any harshness. During content strategy development a  focus was put  upon gathering images that were traveled related but showcased the same feeling of joy. For typography it was important to choose a font that felt more soft and rounded. It was also important that the fonts have a simple modern feel and be easy to read.</p>

                  <p> Despite having some doubt that there would be a way to offer a unique cloud storage service, due to the space being crowded.  However, it was  helpful to evaluate  competitors, and discover that they were under serving the traveling market. This research helped immensely in creating a distinguishable competitive advantage. In further development of the application  I recognized the importance of having a thorough  survey.  It provided invaluable insight and details from users that I served as  strong foundation for the application, and that I could refer to at different stages.</p>
                  <p>Another  key insight I learned through working on this application  is that testing is the best way to silence your inner critic. Due to  the endless options available in design overthinking can go into overdrive. However, clarity quickly comes when you  see a real user navigate  the application.</p>
